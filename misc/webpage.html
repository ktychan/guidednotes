  <p>Welcome to TODO, taught by <a href="https://ktychan.github.io">Kelvin Chan</a>! Feel free to call me Kelvin. I am not big on formalities.</p>

  <p>This is the webpage for <em>lecture materials</em> specific to our section. For all other information about the course (such as course policies, assessments, grades breakdowns, etc), please see the course overview.</p>

  <p><b>Lectures</b>. To help you focus and make the most out of each lecture, complete skeletons of weekly lectures, called üìù fillable lecture notes, are published roughly every Sunday. Look for the emoji üìù on this webpage to download. </p>

  <ul>
    <li> After each lecture, completed notes will be uploaded to their corresponding day below so you can write down what matters most and focus on the content. This webpage is updated after each lecture. Be sure to check back often. </li>
    <li> Most lectures leave you with some do-at-home exercises to help you build fundamental skills. A set of sample solutions will be posted below, typically on Fridays.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><b>Office hours</b> allow you to ask Kelvin questions outside of lecture hours. For example, you can ask Kelvin to explain concepts, help you with exercise problems, help you understand and fix misconceptions, etc. We can chat about anything related to math, although priority is given to course-related discussion. </p>

  <p>Office hours are hosted in the <em>Math-Physics Accelerator</em> located in the Lower Atrium of the Physics and Astronomy building.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>To be determined.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>There are other ways to reach me.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>We can always chat after lectures.</li>
    <li>If my office door is open, you are welcome to come in and chat.</li>
    <li>You are welcome to email Kelvin to set up appointments.</li>
